Trading Legends is an idle-playing mobile phone game with many events and minigames within. The goal of idle-games is to maximise earnings but this is not simple in Trading Legends, due to the different ways earnings can be improved. 

## Introduction
At the start of the game there are 3 main sources of income. The currency is called silvers.
1) Bank
 - Tapping the bank gives silver
 - Upgrading the bank unlocks autotaps per second
2) Market stalls
 - Recruit staff in stalls with silver
 - Each stall has earnings based on: (Stall base * staff number) * bonuses
3) Heirs
 - Heirs have earnings (salary) which increases while you raise them and becomes fixed once they are adults
 - Heir earnings depends mainly on their mother intimacy, and can also be increased by other bonuses
